# Commit changes to the repository
# This script stages all changes, commits them with a specified message, and pushes them to the main branch of the remote repository.
# Usage:
#   ./commit_changes.sh
# Make sure to give execute permission to the script before running:
#   chmod +x commit_changes.sh
# Note: Customize the commit message as needed. 
# Ensure you have the necessary permissions to push to the repository.
# Also, ensure that your local branch is up to date with the remote branch to avoid conflicts.
# Example:
#   ./commit_changes.sh
# This will stage all changes, commit them with the message "add java docs and update readme", and push to the main branch.
# End of script
